I am excited to apply for the Business Development Representative role with
 Invest Northern Ireland. My background in research, analysis, and client 
 engagement—from conducting data-driven studies at Northwestern University to
  supporting sales with the Chicago Cubs—aligns closely with your goals of 
  attracting and supporting U.S. companies. As a Teaching Assistant and 
  Front-End Engineer, I honed communication, technical, and organizational 
  skills essential for market analysis and outreach. I bring persistence, 
  analytical strength, and enthusiasm to support Invest NI’s mission of 
  driving economic growth.
