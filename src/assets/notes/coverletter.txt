    Hello! I am a recent graduate with a masters in Computer
Science with expertise SQL and creating optimized queries. I
have multiple years experience in python and relational
databases. Recent experience with front end development with ad
agencies whose clients are from different sectors
(communication, healthcare, finance, etc.). I have worked in a
small group to design, develop, test, and deploy projects with
tight deadlines. 
I am known as an innovative problem solver and eager to
continue to learn new languages and programs. With each project,
my aim is to understand how to best engage my audience for an
impactful user experience to commit to a higher standard of
excellence. I am best known as an initiator to plan out our
future steps to complete the project, a listener to my
teammates' unique perspectives to improve the project, and your
go-to person to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
I am excited to leverage my skill as part of a fast-paced,
quality-driven team to build a better experience on the web.
