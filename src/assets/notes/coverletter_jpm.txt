From my time as a research technologist I would analyze cellular protein data
 to make tables and graphs to recommend what other experiments could be done
 to further investigate the cellular protein, lamins and vimentins which are
 proteins part of the cytoskeleton of a cell. During my Big Data Analysis 
 and Database Programming classes from my master’s program, I have 
 developed strong skills in analyzing complex datasets using advanced SQL
 in class projects analyzing from a food and recipe project and a friend's 
 “dating” project. I have experience in statistical problem-solving and 
 analyzing data sets using SQL and python in my sleep analysis project from
 my data mining course. I was a teaching assistant and I have experience 
 reading, analyzing, and grading student code in Java and I have a great 
 understanding of how to identify good code and give feedback to students
 when necessary. 

Thank you for your consideration.
