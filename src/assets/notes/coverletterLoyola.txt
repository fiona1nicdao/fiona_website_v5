I am known as an innovative problem solver and eager to
continue to learn new languages and programs. With each project,
my aim is to understand how to best engage my audience for an
impactful user experience to commit to a higher standard of
excellence. I am best known as an initiator to plan out our
future steps to complete the project, a listener to my
teammates' unique perspectives to improve the project, and your
go-to person to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
I am excited to leverage my skill as part of a fast-paced,
quality-driven team to build a better experience on the web.


Thank you for your consideration.
